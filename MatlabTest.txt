[[ID:Q204.2]]
<b>Bimanual Dexterity: </b>
[[Choices]]
Uses only one hand, ignores nondominant hand, poor coordination<br/> 1 
2
Uses both hands, but does not optimize interaction between hands<br/> 3
4
Expertly uses both hands in a complementary way to provide best exposure<br/>5

[[Question:MC:SingleAnswer:Horizontal]]
[[ID:Q204.3]]
<b>Efficiency: </b>
[[Choices]]
Inefficient efforts; many uncertain movements; constantly changing focus or persisting without progress<br/> 1
2
Slow, but planned movements are reasonably organized<br/> 3
4
Confident, efficient and safe conduct, maintains focus on task, fluid progression<br /> 5

[[Question:MC:SingleAnswer:Horizontal]]
[[ID:Q204.4]]
<b>Force Sensitivity: </b>
[[Choices]]
Rough moves, tears tissue, injures nearby structures, poor control, frequent suture breakage<br/> 1
2
Handles tissues reasonably well, minor trauma to adjacent tissue, rare suture breakage<br/> 3
4
Applies appropriate tension, negligible injury to adjacent structures, no suture breakage<br/> 5

[[Question:MC:SingleAnswer:Horizontal]]
[[ID:Q204.5]]
<b>Robotic Control: </b>
[[Choices]]
Consistently does not optimize view, hand position, or repeated collisions even with guidance<br /> 1
2
View is sometimes not optimal. Occasionally needs to relocate arms. Occasional collisions and obstruction of assistant<br /> 3
4
Controls camera and hand position optimally and independently. Minimal collisions or obstruction of assistant<br /> 5
